# Arithmetic Operator
a= 12
b=4
c= a+b
print(c)

# Assignment Operator
a= 10 # Assign 10 in a 
# a += 2 # Increment the value of a by 2 and assign it to a
a -= 2 # Decrement the value of a by 2 and assign it to a
print(a)

#Comparision Operator
b = 4<=5
print(b)

#Logical Operator
# As you already know about, in "or" if any of one is true then the output is True
print(True or False)
print(True or True)

# in 'and' if any of one is false, then the result will be false
print(True and False)   
print(True and True)

# "not" reverse the result, true to false, false to true
print(not(False))
